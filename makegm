# You can't directly call a function in another shell script.
# You can move your function definitions into a separate file and then load them into your script using the . command, like this:
# . /path/to/functions.sh
# This will interpret functions.sh as if it's content were actually present in your file at this point.
# This is a common mechanism for implementing shared libraries of shell functions.
